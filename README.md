Build with 1 bit isometric blocks, use mouse to navigate right side menus (dice icons), left click on the menu dice and it will open. Left click to choose a tile & left click to choose a color. Right click to clear the selected tile, middle button creates a space in a vertical tile stack.
Escape key to exit. Bloom shader is not implemented, however scan lines are implemented in the settings menu. Made with Go (Golang) and the Raylib bindings.
